**Frequentist** -> Relative frequency of occurrence of an event (observed in repetitions) in an experiment is a measure of the probability of that event. It can be stated as 
                   having a model assuming data.  

**Bayesian** -> Having data assuming a model, which translates to saying weâ€™re uncertain about our model but the ground truth (reality) is our data.
