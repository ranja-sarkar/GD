**Frequentist** -> Relative frequency of occurrence of an event (observed in repetitions) in an experiment is a measure of the probability of that event.   

**Bayesian** -> Weâ€™re uncertain about our model but the ground truth (reality) is our data; *Focus on the degree of belief about an unknown. Probability is a measure of how likely something is, given our current knowledge.* 


It is all about beliefs in a Bayesian approach. The data we collect updates our prior (initial) belief. The posterior represents our updated understanding.

Bayesian statistics finds the likelihood of alternatives explaining the data but strictly says these alternatives are driven by priors, which are informed or sensible but rarely objective. Bayesianism leaves a room for subjectivity.

Bayesian thinking is about changing our mind and updating how we understand the world. The data we observe/collect is all that's real, so our beliefs ultimately need to shift until they align with the data.
