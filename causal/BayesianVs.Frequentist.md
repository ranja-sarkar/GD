**Frequentist** -> Relative frequency of occurrence of an event (observed in repetitions) in an experiment is a measure of the probability of that event. It can be stated as 
                   having a model assuming data.  

**Bayesian** -> Having data assuming a model, which translates to saying weâ€™re uncertain about our model but the ground truth (reality) is our data; *Focus on the degree of belief about an unknown. Probability is a measure of how likely something is, given our current knowledge.*

Bayesian statistics finds the likelihood of alternatives explaining the data but strictly says these alternatives are driven by priors, which are informed or sensible but rarely objective. Bayesianism leaves a room for subjectivity.
