Assessing the difference between **statistical significance** and **practical significance** is important while making effective business decisions, 
particularly in marketing. There are far more intricacies in understanding whether a certain marketing strategy is meaningful in enhancing the purchasing/buying behavior 
of consumers than what a statistical test reveals.

Practical significance considers whether the difference between two actions (effect size) is large enough to be meaningful and relevant in a real-world context. It is essential to measure the impact of marketing efforts to understand to what extent the sensitive segment of customers are retained and 
by sensitive I mean, the ones who help generate the company's most revenue. 

The measurement of the impact an action or strategy generates on the business in the long-term when compared to no action taken becomes complex 
since the effect might get diluted over time. Thus it is necessary to infer the causal effect.
