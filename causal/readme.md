Assessing the difference between **statistical significance** and **practical significance** is important while making effective business decisions, 
particularly in marketing. There are far more intricacies in understanding whether a certain marketing strategy is meaningful in enhancing the purchasing/buying behavior 
of consumers than what a statistical test reveals.

Practical significance considers whether the difference between two actions (effect size) is large enough to be meaningful and relevant in a real-world context. It is essential to measure the impact of marketing efforts to understand to what extent the sensitive segment of customers are retained and 
by sensitive I mean, the ones who help generate the company's most revenue. 

The measurement of the impact a marketing effort or strategy generates on the business in the long-term when compared to no effort taken becomes complex 
since the effect might get diluted over time. Thus it is necessary to infer the causal effect. 

# Measuring causal effect

The measurement is done with the difference between the effect generated in the consumers stimulated with marketing gimmick (test group) and those not stimulated (control group). The effect has binary outcomes - one when the consumer receives the stimulus and zero when he/she does not recieve the stimulus.

The stimulus is a treatment. The test and control groups must be randomized for an unbiased measurement. Choosing the groups randomly ensures that all covariates before the stimulus are kept in same proportions for the groups. This means there is no covariate that determines which group a consumer belongs to.
