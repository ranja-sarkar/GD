A linearity in coefficients of (predictor) variables is the assumption of linear regression. A non-linear relationship between the predictor and response/target variable might exist while still preserving the linear model. 

Because it is X that is squared or cubed, not the beta coefficient, the regression still qualifies as a linear model.

Scale changes of the variables only affect the ontercepts and not the slopes if there's no multiplicative term like interaction or polynomial.
