# Binary classification by logistic regression

There is an outcome y such that y falls into one of two categories (say 0 or 1).
The resulting probability is compared to a threshold to predict a class for y, based on X.

There're 2 approaches to finding the coefficients in logistic regression:

i. Gradient Descent

ii. MLE
